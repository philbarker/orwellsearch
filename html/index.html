	<h1>Orwell Search</h1>
  <p><strong>Search works by and about George Orwell. Try, for example, <em>tea</em> or <em>Wigan</em>.</strong> </p>

<div class="gcse-search"></div>
<p><strong>After the initial search</strong> you will be able to refine your search by source, e.g. Orwell's diaries or a specific novel. Do try that, for reasons I really don't understand, sometimes narrowing on a specific source increases the number of results. (Google foo, go figure!?)</p>
